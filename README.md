## CHANGELOG

### 2025-12-19

Updated `build-and-copy.sh` to support copying to multiple hosts (thanks @eric-humane for the contribution).
- Added `-c, --copy-to` (accepts space- or comma-separated host lists) and kept `--copy-to-host` as a backward-compatible alias.
- Added `--copy-parallel` to copy to all hosts concurrently.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Short `-h` argument is now used for help. Use `-c` for copy.

### 2025-12-18

- Added `launch-cluster.sh` convenience script for basic cluster management - see details below.
- Added `-j` / `--build-jobs` argument to `build-and-copy.sh` to control build parallelism.
- Added `--nccl-debug` option to specify NCCL debug level. Default is none to decrease verbosity.

### 2025-12-15

Updated `build-and-copy.sh` flags:
- Renamed `--triton-sha` to `--triton-ref` to support branches and tags in addition to commit SHAs.
- Added `--vllm-ref <ref>`: Specify vLLM commit SHA, branch or tag (defaults to `main`).

### 2025-12-14

Converted to multi-stage Docker build with improved build times and reduced final image size. The builder stage is now separate from the runtime stage, excluding unnecessary build tools from the final image.

Added timing statistics to `build-and-copy.sh` to track Docker build and image copy durations, displaying a summary at the end.

Triton is now being built from the source, alongside with its companion triton_kernels package. The Triton version is set to v3.5.1 by default, but it can be changed by using `--triton-sha` parameter.

Added new flags to `build-and-copy.sh`:
- `--triton-sha <sha>`: Specify Triton commit SHA (defaults to v3.5.1 currently)
- `--no-build`: Skip building and only copy existing image (requires `--copy-to`)

### 2025-12-11 update

PR for MiniMax-M2 has been merged into main, so removed the temporary patch from Dockerfile.

### 2025-12-11

Applied a patch to fix broken MiniMax-M2 in some quants after [this commit](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/d017bceb08eaac7bae2c499124ece737fb4fb22b) until [this PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/30389) is approved. 
See [this issue](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/30445) for details.

### 2025-12-05

Added `build-and-copy.sh` for convenience.

### 2025-11-26

Initial release.
Updated RoCE configuration example to include both interfaces in the list.
Applied patch to enable FastSafeTensors in cluster configuration (EXPERIMENTAL) and added documentation on fastsafetensors use.

## 1\. Building the Docker Image

### Building Manually

The Dockerfile includes specific **Build Arguments** to allow you to selectively rebuild layers (e.g., update the vLLM source code without re-downloading PyTorch).
Using a provided build script is recommended, but if you want to build using `docker build` command, here are the supported build arguments:

| Argument | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CACHEBUST_DEPS` | `1` | Change this to force a re-download of PyTorch, FlashInfer, and system dependencies. |
| `CACHEBUST_VLLM` | `1` | Change this to force a fresh git clone and rebuild of vLLM source code. |
| `TRITON_REF` | `v3.5.1` | Triton commit SHA, branch, or tag to build. |
| `VLLM_REF` | `main` | vLLM commit SHA, branch, or tag to build. |
| `BUILD_JOBS` | `16` | Number of parallel build jobs (default: 16). |

### Using the Build Script (Recommended)

The `build-and-copy.sh` script automates the build process and optionally copies the image to one or more nodes. This is the recommended method for building and deploying to multiple Spark nodes.

**Basic usage (build only):**

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh
```

**Build with a custom tag:**

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --tag my-vllm-node
```

**Build and copy to Spark node(s):**

Using the same username as currently logged-in user (single host):

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --copy-to 192.168.177.12
```

Copy to multiple hosts (space- or comma-separated after the flag):

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --copy-to 192.168.177.12 192.168.177.13
```

Copy to multiple hosts in parallel:

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --copy-to 192.168.177.12 192.168.177.13 --copy-parallel
```

Using a different username:

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --copy-to 192.168.177.12 --user your_username
```

**Force rebuild vLLM source only:**

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --rebuild-vllm
```

**Force rebuild all dependencies:**

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --rebuild-deps
```

**Combined example (rebuild vLLM and copy to another node):**

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --rebuild-vllm --copy-to 192.168.177.12
```

**Build with specific Triton commit:**

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --triton-ref abc123def456
```

**Copy existing image without rebuilding:**

```bash
./build-and-copy.sh --no-build --copy-to 192.168.177.12
```

**Available options:**

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-t, --tag <tag>` | Image tag (default: 'vllm-node') |
| `--rebuild-deps` | Force rebuild all dependencies (sets CACHEBUST_DEPS) |
| `--rebuild-vllm` | Force rebuild vLLM source only (sets CACHEBUST_VLLM) |
| `--triton-ref <ref>` | Triton commit SHA, branch or tag (default: 'v3.5.1') |
| `--vllm-ref <ref>` | vLLM commit SHA, branch or tag (default: 'main') |
| `-c, --copy-to <host[,host...] or host host...>` | Host(s) to copy the image to after building (space- or comma-separated list after the flag). |
| `--copy-to-host` | Alias for `--copy-to` (backwards compatibility). |
| `--copy-parallel` | Copy to all specified hosts concurrently. |
| `-j, --build-jobs <jobs>` | Number of parallel build jobs (default: Dockerfile default) |
| `-u, --user <user>` | Username for SSH connection (default: current user) |
| `--no-build` | Skip building, only copy existing image (requires `--copy-to`) |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

**IMPORTANT**: When copying to another node, make sure you use the Spark IP assigned to its ConnectX 7 interface (enp1s0f1np1), and not the 10G interface (enP7s7)!

### Copying the container to another Spark node (Manual Method)

Alternatively, you can manually copy the image directly to your second Spark node via ConnectX 7 interface by using the following command:

```bash
docker save vllm-node | ssh your_username@another_spark_hostname_or_ip "docker load"
```

**IMPORTANT**: make sure you use Spark IP assigned to it's ConnectX 7 interface (enp1s0f1np1) , and not 10G one (enP7s7)!

-----

## 2\. Launching the Cluster (Recommended)

The `launch-cluster.sh` script simplifies the process of starting the cluster nodes. It handles Docker parameters, network interface detection, and node configuration automatically.

### Basic Usage

**Start the container (auto-detects everything):**

```bash
./launch-cluster.sh
```

This will:
1.  Auto-detect the active InfiniBand and Ethernet interfaces.
2.  Auto-detect the node IP.
3.  Launch the container in interactive mode.
4.  Start the Ray cluster node (head or worker depending on the IP).

Assumptions and limitations:

- It assumes that you've already set up passwordless SSH access on all nodes. If not, follow NVidia's [Connect Two Sparks Playbook](https://build.nvidia.com/spark/connect-two-sparks/stacked-sparks). I recommend setting up static IPs in the configuration instead of automatically assigning them every time, but this script should work with automatically assigned addresses too.
- By default, it assumes that the container image name is `vllm-node`. If it differs, you need to specify it with `-t <name>` parameter.
- If both ConnectX **physical** ports are utilized, and both have IP addresses, it will use whatever interface it finds first. Use `--eth-if` to override.
- It will ignore IPs associated with the 2nd "clone" of the physical interface. For instance, the outermost port on Spark has two logical Ethernet interfaces: `enp1s0f1np1` and `enP2p1s0f1np1`. Only `enp1s0f1np1` will be used. To override, use `--eth-if` parameter.
- It assumes that the same physical interfaces are named the same on all nodes (IOW, enp1s0f1np1 refers to the same physical port on all nodes). If it's not the case, you will have to launch cluster nodes manually or modify the script.
- It will mount only `~/.cache/huggingface` to the container by default. If you want to mount other caches, you'll have to pass set `VLLM_SPARK_EXTRA_DOCKER_ARGS` environment variable, e.g.: `VLLM_SPARK_EXTRA_DOCKER_ARGS="-v $HOME/.cache/vllm:/root/.cache/vllm" ./launch-cluster.sh ...`. Please note that you must use `$HOME` instead of `~` here as the latter won't be expanded if passed through the variable to docker arguments.


**Start in daemon mode (background):**

```bash
./launch-cluster.sh -d
```

**Stop the container:**

```bash
./launch-cluster.sh stop
```

**Check status:**

```bash
./launch-cluster.sh status
```

**Execute a command inside the running container:**

```bash
./launch-cluster.sh exec vllm serve ...
```

### Auto-Detection

The script attempts to automatically detect:
*   **Ethernet Interface:** The interface associated with the active InfiniBand device that has an IP address.
*   **InfiniBand Interface:** The active InfiniBand devices. By default both active RoCE interfaces that correspond to active IB port(s) will be utilized.
*   **Node Role:** Based on the detected IP address and the list of nodes (defaults to `192.168.177.11` as head and `192.168.177.12` as worker).

### Manual Overrides

You can override the auto-detected values if needed:

```bash
./launch-cluster.sh --nodes "10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2" --eth-if enp1s0f1np1 --ib-if rocep1s0f1
```

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-n, --nodes` | Comma-separated list of node IPs (Head node first). |
| `-t` | Docker image name (default: `vllm-node`). |
| `--name` | Container name (default: `vllm_node`). |
| `--eth-if` | Ethernet interface name. |
| `--ib-if` | InfiniBand interface name. |
| `--nccl-debug` | NCCL debug level (e.g., INFO, WARN). Defaults to INFO if flag is present but value is omitted. |
| `--check-config` | Check configuration and auto-detection without launching. |
| `-d` | Run in daemon mode (detached). |

## 3\. Running the Container (Manual)

Ray and NCCL require specific Docker flags to function correctly across multiple nodes (Shared memory, Network namespace, and Hardware access).

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --gpus all \
  --net=host \
  --ipc=host \
  --privileged \
  --name vllm_node \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  vllm-node bash
```

Or if you want to start the cluster node (head or regular), you can launch with the run-cluster.sh script (see details below):

**On head node:**

```bash
docker run --privileged --gpus all -it --rm \
  --ipc=host \
  --network host \
  --name vllm_node \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  vllm-node ./run-cluster-node.sh \
    --role head \
    --host-ip 192.168.177.11 \
    --eth-if enp1s0f1np1 \
    --ib-if rocep1s0f1,roceP2p1s0f1 
```

**On worker node**

```bash
docker run --privileged --gpus all -it --rm \
  --ipc=host \
  --network host \
  --name vllm_node \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  vllm-node ./run-cluster-node.sh \
    --role node \
    --host-ip 192.168.177.12 \
    --eth-if enp1s0f1np1 \
    --ib-if rocep1s0f1,roceP2p1s0f1 \
    --head-ip 192.168.177.11
```

**IMPORTANT**: use the IP addresses associated with ConnectX 7 interface, not with 10G or wireless one!


**Flags Explained:**

  * `--net=host`: **Required.** Ray and NCCL need full access to host network interfaces.
  * `--ipc=host`: **Recommended.** Allows shared memory access for PyTorch/NCCL. As an alternative, you can set it via `--shm-size=16g`.
  * `--privileged`: **Recommended for InfiniBand.** Grants the container access to RDMA devices (`/dev/infiniband`). As an alternative, you can pass `--ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --device=/dev/infiniband`.

-----

## 4\. Using `run-cluster-node.sh` (Internal)

The script is used to configure the environment and launch Ray either in head or node mode.

Normally you would start it with the container like in the example above, but you can launch it inside the Docker session manually if needed (but make sure it's not already running).

### Syntax

```bash
./run-cluster-node.sh [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Long Flag | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-r` | `--role` | Role of the machine: `head` or `node`. | **Yes** |
| `-h` | `--host-ip` | The IP address of **this** specific machine (for ConnectX port, e.g. `enp1s0f1np1`). | **Yes** |
| `-e` | `--eth-if` | ConnectX 7 Ethernet interface name (e.g., `enp1s0f1np1`). | **Yes** |
| `-i` | `--ib-if` | ConnectX 7 InfiniBand interface name (e.g., `rocep1s0f1` - on Spark specifically you want to use both "twins": `rocep1s0f1,roceP2p1s0f1`). | **Yes** |
| `-m` | `--head-ip` | The IP address of the **Head Node**. | Only if role is `node` |


**Hint**: to decide which interfaces to use, you can run `ibdev2netdev`. You will see an output like this:

```
rocep1s0f0 port 1 ==> enp1s0f0np0 (Down)
rocep1s0f1 port 1 ==> enp1s0f1np1 (Up)
roceP2p1s0f0 port 1 ==> enP2p1s0f0np0 (Down)
roceP2p1s0f1 port 1 ==> enP2p1s0f1np1 (Up)
```

Each physical port on Spark has two pairs of logical interfaces in Linux. 
Current NVIDIA guidance recommends using only one of them, in this case it would be `enp1s0f1np1` for Ethernet, but use **both** `rocep1s0f1,roceP2p1s0f1` for IB.

You need to make sure you allocate IP addresses to them (no need to allocate IP to their "twins").

### Example: Starting inside the Head Node

```bash
./run-cluster-node.sh \
  --role head \
  --host-ip 192.168.177.11 \
  --eth-if enp1s0f1np1 \
  --ib-if rocep1s0f1,roceP2p1s0f1
```

### Example: Starting inside a Worker Node

```bash
./run-cluster-node.sh \
  --role node \
  --host-ip 192.168.177.12 \
  --eth-if enp1s0f1np1 \
  --ib-if rocep1s0f1,roceP2p1s0f1 \
  --head-ip 192.168.177.11
```

-----

## 5\. Configuration Details

### Environment Persistence

The script automatically appends exported variables to `~/.bashrc`. If you need to open a second terminal into the running container for debugging, simply run:

```bash
docker exec -it vllm_node bash
```

All environment variables (NCCL, Ray, vLLM config) set by the startup script will be loaded automatically in this new session.

## 6\. Using cluster mode for inference

First, start follow the instructions above to start the head container on your first Spark, and node container on the second Spark.
Then, on the first Spark, run vllm like this:

```bash
docker exec -it vllm_node bash -i -c "vllm serve RedHatAI/Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct-NVFP4 --port 8888 --host 0.0.0.0 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.7 -tp 2 --distributed-executor-backend ray --max-model-len 32768"
```

Alternatively, run an interactive shell first:

```bash
docker exec -it vllm_node
```

And execute vllm command inside.

## 7\. Fastsafetensors

This build includes support for fastsafetensors loading which significantly improves loading speeds, especially on DGX Spark where MMAP performance is very poor currently.
[Fasttensors](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fastsafetensors/) solve this issue by using more efficient multi-threaded loading while avoiding mmap.

This build also implements an EXPERIMENTAL patch to allow use of fastsafetensors in a cluster configuration (it won't work without it!).
Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fastsafetensors/issues/36) for the details.

To use this method, simply include `--load-format fastsafetensors` when running VLLM, for example:

```bash
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 vllm serve openai/gpt-oss-120b --port 8888 --host 0.0.0.0 --trust_remote_code --swap-space 16 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.7 -tp 2 --distributed-executor-backend ray --load-format fastsafetensors
```

## 8\. Benchmarking

Follow the guidance in [VLLM Benchmark Suites](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/contributing/benchmarks/) to download benchmarking dataset, and then run a benchmark with a command like this (assuming you are running on head node, otherwise specify `--host` parameter):

```bash 
vllm bench serve \
  --backend vllm \
  --model RedHatAI/Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct-NVFP4 \
  --endpoint /v1/completions   --dataset-name sharegpt \
  --dataset-path ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json \
  --num-prompts 1 \
  --port 8888 
```

Modify `--num-prompts` to benchmark concurrent requests - the command above will give you single request performance.

### Hardware Architecture

**Note:** The Dockerfile defaults to `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.1a` (NVIDIA GB10). If you are using different hardware, update the `ENV` variable in the Dockerfile before building.
